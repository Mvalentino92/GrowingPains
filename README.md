Some fun games I wrote in Python when I was first learning how to code. Left as is for genuine progress tracking.

Python was the first language I spent a lot of time with. It's what got me very interested in programming not only as a tool for solving problems, but as a creative outlet as well

The majority of the files are little games I made for my own amusement and accomplishment. No files are really commented, and I wanted to keep it that way so they can serve as a demonstration of my progress. 

A few of the files are helpful functions/scripts that were inspired by one of my biology courses during the school year.

Enjoy! (Well looking at the code that is! Most of the games are reliant on files that are on my computer!)
